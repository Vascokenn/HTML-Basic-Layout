    <h1>Flutter Framework</h1>
    <p>
        Flutter is a free and open-source mobile application development
         framework created by Google. It is used to develop high-performance, 
         natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop, from a single codebase. 
         Flutter uses the Dart programming language, which offers features
          like just-in-time (JIT) compilation, a modern syntax, and a variety of
           tools and libraries to make app development faster and more efficient.
            Flutter also offers a rich set of pre-built widgets and tools, which can
             be used to build beautiful user interfaces and complex animations quickly
              and easily. With Flutter, developers can build stunning apps that can run
               on multiple platforms and devices with ease.This is exactly what I wanna do.
